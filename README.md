# SUTD WHAT THE HACK 2024: SustaiNibbles (Gyattmorningteam)
## Circular Economy & Sustainable Living

# Description
**SustaiNibbles** (Sustainable + Edible/Nibbles) is a Telegram bot initiative designed to tackle food waste by connecting individuals and businesses with surplus leftover food. 

Catering companies often discard leftover meals after events, and food and beverage establishments frequently face unsold items at the end of the day or week. SustaiNibbles aims to provide an accessible platform for businesses and individuals to send and receive notifications about available surplus food, making it easier to share what would otherwise go to waste. By increasing access to excess food, reducing waste and promoting sustainable practices, SustaiNibbles helps **build a more circular economy, sustainable lifestyle and resource-efficient community**.

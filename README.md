Connecting Communities, Reducing Food WasteSustaiNibbles (Sustainable+Nibbles) is a Telegram bot designed to curb food waste by providing individuals with leftover food from food related businesses

## Inspiration
One of our teammates got inspiration behind SustaiNibbles from one of their sisters, who works part-time in a café. At the end of her shifts, she often brings back leftover sandwiches—still fresh and entirely consumable but unable to be sold the next day. She told me this was standard practice across many cafés and restaurants. While these businesses dislike the idea of wasting food, they often lack the infrastructure or connections to donate it. This gave us the idea to develop **SustaiNibbles**, aiming to provide an accessible platform for businesses and individuals to send and receive notifications about available surplus food, making it easier to share what would otherwise go to waste.

## What it does
**SustaiNibbles** (Sustainable + Edible/Nibbles) is a Telegram bot designed to tackle food waste by providing individuals with leftover food from food related businesses. 

Catering companies often discard leftover meals after events, furthermore, food and beverage establishments frequently face unsold items at the end of the day or week. SustaiNibbles aims to provide an **accessible platform for businesses and individuals** to send and receive notifications about available surplus food, making it easier to share what would otherwise go to waste.

## How we built it
SustaiNibbles was built using the `python-telegram-bot` library on Python to interface the Telgram UI, with MySQL. The telegram bot was initialised using Telegram's BotFather.

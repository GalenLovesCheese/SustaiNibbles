## **Circular Economy & Sustainable Living**
### **Background**
Food waste is a pressing global issue with far-reaching environmental, economic, and social implications. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), approximately one-third of all food produced globally—about 1.3 billion tons—is wasted every year. This waste occurs across the supply chain, from production and processing to retail and consumption. Such wastage not only squanders valuable resources like water, energy, and labor but also contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions when discarded food ends up in landfills.

In a circular economy, the goal is to minimize waste and maximize resource use by creating closed-loop systems. This approach contrasts with the traditional linear economy of "take, make, dispose." Circular principles applied to food systems prioritize the recovery and redistribution of surplus food to prevent waste, ensuring edible food benefits communities rather than being discarded. By repurposing food waste for human consumption, compost, or energy, the environmental footprint is reduced, and the value of food resources is retained within the system.

Sustainable living emphasizes mindful consumption and reducing waste at the individual and systemic levels. Tackling food waste aligns with these principles by promoting practices such as sharing surplus food, improving storage methods, and educating consumers about waste reduction.

### **Story Inspiration**


## **Description**
**SustaiNibbles** (Sustainable + Edible/Nibbles) is a Telegram bot initiative designed to tackle food waste by connecting individuals and businesses with surplus leftover food. 

Catering companies often discard leftover meals after events, and food and beverage establishments frequently face unsold items at the end of the day or week. SustaiNibbles aims to provide an accessible platform for businesses and individuals to send and receive notifications about available surplus food, making it easier to share what would otherwise go to waste. By increasing access to excess food, reducing waste and promoting sustainable practices, SustaiNibbles helps **build a more circular economy, sustainable lifestyle and resource-efficient community**.

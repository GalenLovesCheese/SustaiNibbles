# **SUTD WHAT THE HACK 2024: SustaiNibbles (Gyattmorningteam)**
## **Circular Economy & Sustainable Living**
### **Description**
**SustaiNibbles** (Sustainable + Edible/Nibbles) is a Telegram bot designed to tackle food waste by providing individuals with leftover food from food related businesses. 

Catering companies often discard leftover meals after events, furthermore, food and beverage establishments frequently face unsold items at the end of the day or week. SustaiNibbles aims to provide an accessible platform for businesses and individuals to send and receive notifications about available surplus food, making it easier to share what would otherwise go to waste. By increasing access to excess food, reducing waste and promoting sustainable practices, SustaiNibbles helps **build a more circular economy, sustainable lifestyle, and resource-efficient community**.

### **Background**
Food waste is a pressing global issue with far-reaching environmental, economic, and social implications. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), approximately one-third of all food produced globally—about 1.3 billion tons—is wasted every year. This waste occurs across the supply chain, from production and processing to retail and consumption. Such wastage not only squanders valuable resources like water, energy, and labor but also contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions when discarded food ends up in landfills.

In a circular economy, the goal is to minimize waste and maximize resource use by creating closed-loop systems where waste is never generated. This approach contrasts with the principles of more traditional past economies of "take, make and dispose." Circular principles applied to food systems prioritize the recovery and redistribution of surplus food to prevent waste, ensuring edible food benefits communities rather than being discarded. By repurposing food waste for human consumption, composting, or energy generation, the environmental footprint caused by food waste is reduced, and the value of food resources is retained within the system.

Sustainable living emphasizes mindful consumption and reducing waste at the individual and systemic levels. Tackling food waste aligns with these principles by promoting practices such as sharing surplus food, improving storage methods, and educating consumers about waste reduction.

### **Idea Inspiration**

The idea of SustaiNibbles came from the experience of one of our team members, Syn Kit. This is an account of the experience that inspired SustaiNibbles.

"My sister works part-time in a café. At the end of her shifts, she often brings back leftover sandwiches—still fresh and entirely consumable but unable to be sold the next day. She told me this was standard practice across many cafés and restaurants. While these businesses dislike the idea of wasting food, they often lack the infrastructure or connections to donate it."

This personal connection sparked an idea. What if there was a way to bridge the gap between businesses with surplus food and individuals or organizations that could benefit from it? The unused food could be a source of nourishment for someone in need, but without an accessible system in place, it often ends up in the trash.
